		Mae: and then like using actual trains #line:540450
		Mae: making little monsters. #line:b2cf15

    Mae: I looked at it every day, it was like a friend outside the window #line:003b76
    Mae: now it was just a thing... just a thing that was there #line:941c9f
    Mae: growing and eating and just /being/ there #line:e9728a
    Mae: like all the stuff i felt about the tree #line:a25282
    Mae: was just in my head #line:9e9efa
    Mae: and there was some guy walking by #line:7eaf72
    Mae: and he was just shapes #line:278823
    Mae: just like this moving bulk of... stuff #line:1b8138
    Mae: and I cried #line:420373
    Mae: because nothing was there for me anymore #line:d718f2
    Mae: it was all just stuff. Stuff in the universe #line:73f1de
    Mae: just... dead #line:5f9857
    Bea: wow... that's... huh #line:35e549
    Mae: And the next day was that softball game #line:f5915d
    Mae: and Andy was the pitcher when I was up #line:ecc63d
    Mae: and he was just shapes too #line:4ef3fb
    Mae: just lines someone wrote #line:0b251e
    Mae: like nothing in there #line:9e0969
    Mae: and I was so scared and angry and just... I dunno #line:791cd0
    Mae: before I knew it I was on top of him #line:e69168
    Mae: smashing his face in with the bat #line:97a9dc
    Mae: just shapes #line:220b02
    Mae: red shapes all over the grass #line:a0dbc1
    Bea: oh my god, mae. #line:1db181
    Bea: have you talked to anyone about this? #line:5ad820
    Mae: after it happened they made me go to therapy #line:2d1b75
    Mae: with Dr. Hank- #line:0c3d62
    Bea: oh gaaaaaaaawd. He’s the worst. #line:f65d14
    Mae: and he made me start a journal #line:45fdac
    Bea: a journal? #line:bde14b
    Mae: yeah he kinda just said it would help to be able to get my thoughts down #line:dc949b
    Bea: did it help? #line:9823ed
    Mae: kinda? sorta? #line:5056d3
    Mae: but since this whole thing happened, when I'm alone in a new place #line:6d03b6
    Mae: it's all shapes, like back at the softball game #line:586596
    Mae: I was doing fine at college for a while #line:eedce4
    Mae: but I couldn't make friends, I was just afraid of being outside or around people alone. #line:f1e890
    Mae: And there was this statue of like the founder of something. #line:054aa7
    Mae: a really shitty statue, like all rusty metal, #line:cc7c76
    Mae: and it was these shapes #line:98f619
    Mae: and he was pointing down at me #line:18dc6f
    Mae: and I was so... scared... I didn't leave my dorm room, #line:5c373d
    Mae: I either didn't eat or I ate entire pizzas at once #line:bf2b38
    Mae: I downed cough syrup just to sleep all the time #line:223714
    Mae: and finally I got up the courage to leave. #line:8fe6f5
    Mae: and I came home. Where everything was fine. #line:d3b2ec
    Mae: where I knew everyone, and it wasn't just... dead shapes. #line:91c30f
    Mae: watching me. #line:8ac271
    Bea: Geez. #line:2025fb
    Mae: something broke. In my head. In my life. #line:c9ad03
    Bea: i don’t mean to be like… whatever, but #line:e0ee3d
    Bea: it sounds like you’re suffering from some serious stuff #line:7b2b4f
    Bea: and like, I can help you find some help for it? #line:ef3b82
    Mae: Dr. Hank already tried! #line:850753
    Bea: I think Dr. Hank should stick to family medicine and dentistry #line:a9f82d
    Bea: and the half dozen other things he does #line:de3073
    Bea: and maybe leave the mental health services to someone else. #line:f340de
    Bea: like there are such things as depression and anxiety and like #line:cbc108
    Bea: i dunno… what you’re going through, it exists. #line:477a62

GodtenderBrown: A wind demon once stole the reflection from a Godtender's Eyes. #line:a3611e
GodtenderBrown: And placed it on the surface of a mirror. #line:863249
GodtenderBrown: To convince a king that he was a god. #line:b466bc
Adina: Why? #line:de1af2
GodtenderBrown: The king jumped from a high tower, thinking he could fly. #line:49e703
GodtenderBrown: And the demon entered his broken body #line:6ebbc5
GodtenderBrown: And ruled his kingdom for 99 years #line:4eadfe
GodtenderBrown: until he was driven out by Saint Balfa and the Charmed Goat. #line:84cc56

Mae: i’ve seen this #line:e664cc
Mae: or I’ve… I’ve felt it… #line:2318c1
HeadMiner: Was Ed Skudder and Jim Dorney who found it. #line:5edb59
HeadMiner: 20 years back or so. #line:4fa2d8
HeadMiner: After the west mine closed out past Briddle #line:2ba925
HeadMiner: Vest Schumacher. Last supervisor. #line:4069f7
HeadMiner: was out there when the company locked off the entrance #line:934427
HeadMiner: carved his initials and date in the door. #line:3afdc1
HeadMiner: Then you got this mine, the Old One. #line:799adc
HeadMiner: not even a proper mine. Big hole. Copper. #line:1fe3b5
HeadMiner: Abandoned, shoot, long before any of us were born. #line:9acaca
HeadMiner: too close to water. #line:cef1b3
HeadMiner: And that water was poison #line:4c5e7d
HeadMiner: when the first settlers came out here. #line:68797c
HeadMiner: that old spring used to be right above where we’re standin’. #line:7459e3
HeadMiner: but that water dried up. #line:2249e6
HeadMiner: 1992 or so some men from west mine #line:d8db32
HeadMiner: come back up here to try bootleggin, #line:5bc533
HeadMiner: practically built a new elevator, got the main tunnel cleared #line:6d7c49
HeadMiner: never found no coal, just dug deeper n' deeper #line:72d500
HeadMiner: til Ed busts through that wall and finds this place #line:a2e2b9
HeadMiner: and Jim walks right into that hole #line:b6c465
HeadMiner: and never hits bottom. #line:a825cc
HeadMiner: Ed calls down to Jim #line:54971f
HeadMiner: Jim don’t answer #line:c7a65e
HeadMiner: but someone else does. #line:3cf62f
HeadMiner: I know you heard that voice, girl. #line:7537b6
HeadMiner: In dreams and in waking times. #line:832e35
HeadMiner: ‘swhat brought you down here.  #line:2c55bd
	-> what... what is it? #line:72418c
		HeadMiner: black goat #line:b32c2b
		HeadMiner: not even black like the color #line:38f3ac
		HeadMiner: black like the space between the stars #line:a804ee
		HeadMiner: he’s down there, in that hole #line:c11bb0
		HeadMiner: looking up at us right now #line:e2d277
		HeadMiner: he don’t talk to ya #line:50a38b
		HeadMiner: he... sings... #line:acd5c5
		Mae: why would you just do something a hole in a cave told you to? #line:c367a8
	-> so what does this have to do with you, or me, or anyone? #line:d85a8c
HeadMiner: you got to understand #line:bcd8f4
HeadMiner: in those days it was the end of the world #line:abb786
HeadMiner: jobs gone. Our kids were leaving. #line:a753b7
HeadMiner: government didn’t care, only wanted our votes. #line:8bb773
HeadMiner: just puttin in more regulations, sendin our jobs overseas, #line:7e9f18
HeadMiner: spendin our taxes on lazy people 'n immigrants #line:577068
HeadMiner: while we worked ourselves to death. #line:adb3fa
Bea: ugh here we go. #line:3e9d63
Bea: goddamn i hate this crap. #line:8163f4
Bea: you old dipshits. #line:624bf1
HeadMiner: you finished? #line:f7fec1
<<wait 2>>
Bea: yeah sure. #line:d27195
HeadMiner: we prayed and prayed up at the church, #line:978d46
HeadMiner: but when Ed Skudder came back down here and listened #line:d9dfdb
HeadMiner: he got answers back. #line:baf109
	-> oh god… i think i know... #line:9f2c7b
		HeadMiner: yeah he’s already in there singin to ya, right? #line:7af2f5
		Mae: I… I… #line:0a4439
	-> answers? #line:2fa067
HeadMiner: Ed explained it to a few folks, and they didn’t believe it #line:87fc7a
HeadMiner: but he was persuasive #line:eeb2f5
HeadMiner: he had the glimmer. #line:cb3240
Mae: "the glimmer?" #line:1015f1
    Miner2: ones 'e takes a shining to #line:0ea804
    Miner2: it rubs off on ya. #line:075950
    Miner2: you can do things. #line:478928
    HeadMiner: I never seen it #line:e79e9f
    HeadMiner: but they said Ed could walk through walls. #line:95fe07
    Mae: ok. #line:a4598f
HeadMiner: after Ed talked us into all this, #line:a75dcb
HeadMiner: after that first time, after we picked one out #line:91876b
HeadMiner: well... #line:d1a65b
HeadMiner: not only was the town holdin' stable #line:2c056c
HeadMiner: but it was almost like we were getting younger, and money came too #line:985d8b
HeadMiner: still a few of us left from back then #line:b0a354
    -> “Picked”? #line:c71d7a
        HeadMiner: first one was Tom Turner, who believe you me was a bastard #line:2b0cf2
        HeadMiner: just pure trash #line:2986b4
        HeadMiner: we got him down here #line:fd26b7
        HeadMiner: and in the hole he went. #line:19f263
        HeadMiner: the next week, flowers bloomin’ all over the hills #line:fe58cc
	-> “First time?” #line:fb8f01
		HeadMiner: First one into the hole by our own hands. #line:f3d3c1
		HeadMiner: We own up to what we do. I was there. #line:20e244
		Miner2: I was too. #line:3456fb
Bea: You throw them in the hole? #line:9fcff6
Mae: ... #line:40cd46
Mae: they’re... feeding him... #line:d94c50
HeadMiner: he's hungry like you wouldn't believe. #line:7e02a3
HeadMiner: every few months or so he starts singin’ #line:08d873
HeadMiner: and it’s someone’s turn to find someone. #line:917b48
    ->was that what you were doing the other night? #line:67df82
        Miner1: No. #line:24d94b
        HeadMiner: What happened the other night was a shame. #line:d4b4b2
        HeadMiner: One of our number broke the rules. #line:f1a6b3
        HeadMiner: an' had to pay up. #line:9ba194
        HeadMiner: that was a hard thing to do #line:98abb3
    ->... #line:465f51
Mae: i think i’m gonna be sick... #line:845e22
HeadMiner: we never pick noone who’s gonna be missed #line:3715ef
HeadMiner: that’s a solid rule. #line:6fd1c9
HeadMiner: Drifters, drunks, and delinquents. #line:17b5f3
Mae: you’ve been… oh god… oh no... #line:9a43d3
	-> How many people have died down here??? #line:da0628
		HeadMiner: oh, I’d say… #line:265865
		Miner1: 3 dozen. Give or take. #line:a66c29
		Miner2: 39. #line:ff2fbb
		Miner2: am I the only one keeping steady count? #line:293c86
		HeadMiner: I do now. Early on I think we all wanted to forget. #line:f3d38f
        Miner1: i still got a feelin' heart. it still hurts. #line:a39d79
        Miner2: yeah that dirtbag kid from the spring... #line:049375
        Gregg: C...c...casey? #line:516c41
	-> Casey?  #line:d0c486
HeadMiner: The Hartley kid? #line:0d1d82
HeadMiner: all he was gonna contribute to society #line:6e0a16
HeadMiner: 'cept a buncha kids growin up with no dad #line:f05a29
HeadMiner: was a rap sheet a mile long #line:d75e7e
HeadMiner: before whatever sad end he’d wind up at. #line:ef33ad
HeadMiner: we did him a FAVOR. #line:67895a
Gregg: You... k-killed... Casey? :( #line:06bbe2
Angus: oh my god. #line:0e524e
HeadMiner: we don’t use that word. #line:17fb63
HeadMiner: you know he was taking up business with his cousin, right? #line:9b811c
HeadMiner: you know what happened to his cousin? #line:15e282
HeadMiner: burned alive when his little trailer lab exploded #line:29a7e8
HeadMiner: they had to wear hazmat suits when they cleaned him up #line:8b470a
HeadMiner: that’s where Casey was headed. #line:072c20
Gregg: You killed Casey. #line:c3a8d8
HeadMiner: and you want to act like we didn’t do him and this whole town a favor? #line:befca1
Mae: oh god... Casey’s been down here the whole time. #line:2b7be5
Mae: his parents put up posters! #line:62e34d

    ->it was like the shore #line:84957d
        Mae: of this giant black ocean #line:88056c
        Mae: i could see like #line:951c74
        Mae: forever into the sky #line:406c1d
        Mae: and below it was just #line:f29b12
        Mae: sand #line:ce3af4
        Mae: as far as i could see #line:d2a398
Mae: i was wandering through it but #line:2ee2b0
Mae: i was like, drawn to something #line:77f36e
Mae: and i came up over this... #line:6a2022
Mae: what do you call a hill made of sand? #line:36a8f2
Pastor: A dune. #line:55217c
Mae: yeah. A Dune. #line:3c51e9
Mae: and there was god. #line:750d5d
Mae: just sitting there. up on another hill. #line:e62b27
Mae: or dune. whatever. #line:65bbfb
Pastor: just hangin' out? #line:eac5d9
Mae: yeah. #line:d84951
Mae: seemed like they were *really* into just hanging out. #line:2c46de
Pastor: did they say anything? #line:6fc72d
Mae: yeah #line:6373f5
    ->they like, didn't care #line:0d5122
        Pastor: they didn't care if you were there? #line:62db2c
        Mae: no, i mean, they didn't care. #line:625e29
        Mae: in general. #line:f3a6bc
    ->they were kind of a... jerk #line:3fa258
        Mae: i mean, more of a straight up asshole. #line:695d65
        Mae: sorry. can i say that in a church? #line:3396dc
        Pastor: ha ha. #line:7e118a
        Pastor: i think the structure can handle the shock. #line:3ced76
Mae: they went on and on about how annoyed they were #line:264093
Mae: that people kept coming to them with questions #line:ad66a4
Mae: and annoyed that anyone thought they were god to begin with #line:278443
Pastor: well, i don't think that was god then #line:0fc56b
Mae: why? #line:891560
Pastor: if something tells you it isn't god #line:1de0be
Pastor: you should probably believe it. #line:8ce8aa
Mae: no, what i mean is that #line:3a1298
Mae: the thing we call god #line:3ad9e2
Mae: isn't god #line:a2e759
Mae: it's just a thing #line:f49749
Mae: and it doesn't care #line:737091
Pastor: hm. #line:4cd0ec
Mae: they kept talking about #line:772faa
    ->how nothing matters #line:15fcef
        Mae: like the universe is ending #line:ece137
        Mae: and everything is being forgotten. #line:a40931
    ->this giant hole #line:456d8d
        Mae: in the center of everything. #line:b091d2
        Mae: growing. #line:b8f609
Pastor: that sounds very lonely. #line:99cfa3
Pastor: have you been feeling lonely lately? #line:3258cc
    ->yes. #line:4cd014
        Mae: i had this problem when i was in high school #line:ce0e8c
        Mae: and i did something really bad. #line:038dd8
        Mae: you probably heard about it. #line:486314
        Pastor: your mom has mentioned it. #line:324148
        Mae: yeah i figured. #line:de0df4
        Mae: well, since then #line:fef455
    ->no. #line:b8bd2c
        Mae: no, i mean i've got friends #line:64dd8f
        Mae: i've been with them every day since i got home. #line:9f0cbb
        Mae: but... hm... #line:b0d125
Mae: there's this deep down loneliness #line:3b05f7
Mae: been there for years #line:43df8e
Mae: since... well, just been a long time. #line:89424d
Pastor: i've been there. #line:2d9d39
Pastor: i mean i'm there all the time #line:2c8c7d
Pastor: i think that's where #line:ebf7fc
Pastor: if we open ourselves up #line:c84a69
Pastor: god can enter our lives most effectively #line:d8d351
    ->i guess #line:b0b340
        Pastor: sometimes that's the best you've got. #line:895f85
        Mae: yeah. #line:7b2fe4
        Mae: ... #line:f00363
        Pastor: i feel like that's maybe not a good enough answer for you #line:c08035
        Mae: is that a good enough answer for anyone? #line:c872ad
    ->i don't think i believe in god anymore #line:9d6f6e
        Pastor: if you want the truth #line:4cde3d
        Pastor: i think everyone doesn't believe in god #line:1cf09c
        Pastor: for at least a few minutes a day #line:06c585
        Mae: hm. #line:c55433
Pastor: faith is a process #line:830509
Pastor: you have to keep getting up and choosing to go on #line:c51b80
Mae: do you really think there's a god? #line:a31dd2
Mae: like, literally someone up there listening? #line:f3e7c7
Mae: is that something you completely believe? #line:609690
Pastor: hm. #line:6ec717
Pastor: i don't know. #line:41b6df
Mae: oh. #line:858787
Pastor: on my best days I think I do. #line:d57daa
Pastor: but there are times where I don't. #line:5aa762
Mae: but... but you stand up there every sunday #line:5c04a4
Mae: and tell people you do! #line:3be58c
Mae: and even *YOU'RE* not sure? #line:3e09c9
Mae: It's your *JOB* to believe. #line:558a8d
Pastor: well, I think it's more my job to serve others... #line:c29f6b
Mae: but you're lying to people! #line:11caf4
Pastor: how? #line:33501c
Mae: you stand up there and tell people to believe #line:8cbaa1
Mae: in something you don't 100% believe in yourself. #line:17d054
Pastor: maybe you're right Mae #line:c054b9
Pastor: and maybe I should get up there every week #line:b81135
Pastor: and give some sort of tally of how much I believed that week #line:e84769
Pastor: but who would that help? #line:e022b8
Mae: but you're a pastor #line:e91c62
Mae: and you can't tell me whether or not god is up there. #line:94e95d
Mae: whether anyone is watching #line:c3708f
Mae: anyone who gives a shit. #line:3d8d48
Pastor: no, but- #line:de0b28

        Chazokov: You know this one already? #line:63a943
        Mae: Nope. #line:28b7f7
Chazokov: This star tells the story of a woman who built a tower to heaven. #line:e8bdf0
Chazokov: And for this the gods sunk her deep into the sea. #line:a5d5ab
Mae: Wow. That's screwed up. #line:eb71e2
Chazokov: But even in the depths, she refused to die. #line:e1c648
Mae:[shake=.01]DAMN STRAIGHT.[/shake] #line:08d014

Chazokov: The gods in these stories are only stand-ins #line:fae4ed

Chazokov: Ah yes. Dohr The Murderer. #line:7aced8
Mae: Ok I'm interested. #line:b91366
Chazokov: Dohr passed Behrn The King's procession on the street. #line:fc471b
Chazokov: Dohr was quiet and said nothing, and the King took offense to this. #line:344272
    ->Why? #line:735ceb
        Chazokov: Royalty is strange. #line:7ae9cd
    ->Geez. #line:e6c552
Mae: So what happened? #line:ac93c3
Chazokov: Behrn insulted Dohr, Dohr's family, Dohr's village, and so on #line:27f339
Chazokov: until he was down to insulting Dohr's chickens. #line:c4d6a6
    ->Damn. #line:905377
    ->Chickens are kind of awful. #line:cd9168

        Chazokov: They are delicious. #line:00173d
        Mae: They deserve to be delicious. #line:a029ba
Chazokov: Dohr first murdered Behrn's chickens. #line:80c609
Chazokov: then his ancestral village #line:b42663
Chazokov: then his family #line:056f4c
Mae: Holy crap. #line:8fb487
Chazokov: And when he came to Behrn #line:c33a1b
Chazokov: the king was silent. #line:828164
Mae: I'm going to get a tattoo of this guy. #line:15e138
Chazokov: Is Dohr a hero? #line:b04272

        Mae: but it doesn't really matter I think? #line:f40d5c
Mae: Like if you've been told you're nothing before #line:4fc565
Mae: A story like this sounds pretty ok. #line:272b5a
Chazokov: Well it is a true story and real people died #line:314376

Chazokov: eh #line:8fb263
Chazokov: by the time they got to these rare stars #line:701fa2
Chazokov: the well known myths and legends were taken. #line:ef6044
Mae: oh. #line:49f7b4
Chazokov: This one, Sterling, is a tale of the world changing #line:f9af8b
Chazokov: and leaving one behind. #line:a96c7c
    ->these are all gonna be bummers, huh? #line:f5ba69
        Chazokov: that is not for me to say. #line:2f95a0
        Chazokov: is it a bad thing for the world to move on? #line:cdafd7
        Mae: Well i mean this guy probably doesn't think so. #line:c0a7bc
    ->was he not psychic? #line:24f162
        Chazokov: who can say? #line:7ec040
        Chazokov: do we believe any tale occurred? #line:407f7c
        Mae: hm. #line:434acc
Chazokov: either way, one day his king met a new sage- #line:3fda4f
Chazokov: an astronomer. #line:29776f
Chazokov: and she showed the king how the planets and stars #line:9f34d9
Chazokov: orbit in regular patterns, and why. #line:4c10e7
Chazokov: and the king kicked Sterling out of his quarters #line:192de7
Chazokov: for the seer had long told the king #line:19e606
Chazokov: a different story about the stars. #line:66a9d2
    ->did Sterling believe his own story? #line:e855b8
        Chazokov: i believe he did. #line:a87ed7
        Mae: well that's how things go. #line:fa53e9
    ->that sounds fair. #line:6058b2
Chazokov: is there no responsibility #line:c0797c
Chazokov: to care for those whose labors #line:f6c04a
Chazokov: even one's universe #line:ec2372
Chazokov: are suddenly replaced with a new one? #line:24cc6e
Chazokov: are they obsolete? #line:206642
    ->that's how life is! #line:e04255
        Chazokov: so you believe #line:18602a
        Chazokov: that some should go hungry #line:a6f6f5
        Chazokov: and without homes #line:b14c10
        Chazokov: because they are no longer useful #line:58145d

Chazokov: Ah yes! Simone the fighter! #line:c4ad15
Mae: she got a gun #line:43c6c9
Chazokov: Simone lived in a good land #line:d49e94
Chazokov: but under every good land are the roots of oppression #line:0950ea
Chazokov: and in this land those roots took hold #line:a75caa
Chazokov: and choked out all else. #line:0fc6f0
    ->that was poetic, Mr. Chazokov #line:46e16c
        Chazokov: thanks. I was just reading the summary off my phone. #line:39360f
        Mae: oh #line:b2ac31
        Chazokov: we may not have signal, but we have wifi! #line:0996f7
    ->geez. #line:4fa3ca
        Chazokov: it happens faster than one can imagine #line:0024f3
Chazokov: Anyway, when the borders closed and the curfew began #line:0f2f5e
Chazokov: Simone and her comrades began to plot. #line:ed6d82
Chazokov: they infiltrated, they sabotaged, they freed prisoners. #line:0c1fff
Mae: very nice. #line:666015
Chazokov: Simone was one of the first to be identified #line:998886
Chazokov: but she evaded capture even as the wanted posters went up. #line:91febb
Chazokov: As whispers of her grew throughout the land #line:e7c5f2
Chazokov: more and more of her neighbors prayed in the night #line:94b3c9
Chazokov: that Simone would be their salvation. #line:cc484c
    ->was she? #line:a4a096
    ->that's a lot of pressure for one person. #line:2e8636
        Chazokov: She was not alone, of course. #line:7a5993
        Chazokov: she was but one part in a growing organism #line:50e2d7
        Chazokov: but she became a symbol. #line:1e535e
        Chazokov: it is difficult to think of many things #line:810752
        Chazokov: so sometimes having a symbol for all of them #line:e6b960
        Chazokov: is important. #line:770135
        Mae: like numbers. #line:1a7af5
Chazokov: We do not know where Simone is buried. #line:21a9cd
Mae: ah goddammit. i knew this wasn't going to be happy. #line:15772b
Chazokov: we do know that when things boiled over #line:e99031
Chazokov: she led a charge against the palace gates #line:bda050
Chazokov: and behind those gates were cannons. #line:1b953f
Mae: oh no. #line:70c0f4
Chazokov: many years later when the mass graves were exhumed #line:43c195
Chazokov: her bones were mixed with so many others #line:9da60a
Chazokov: it was said that she now lives on #line:09ef66
Chazokov: in the bones of all in her country. #line:484d6d
Mae: geez. that got dark. and sad. and spooky. #line:4de239
